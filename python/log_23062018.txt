DESCRIPTION
    This module is always available.  It provides access to the
    mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

FUNCTIONS
    acos(...)
        acos(x)
        
        Return the arc cosine (measured in radians) of x.
    
    acosh(...)
        acosh(x)
        
        Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x.
    
    asin(...)
        asin(x)
        
        Return the arc sine (measured in radians) of x.
    
    asinh(...)
        asinh(x)
        
        Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x.
    
    atan(...)
        atan(x)
        
        Return the arc tangent (measured in radians) of x.
    
    atan2(...)
        atan2(y, x)
        
        Return the arc tangent (measured in radians) of y/x.
        Unlike atan(y/x), the signs of both x and y are considered.
    
    atanh(...)
        atanh(x)
        
        Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x.
    
    ceil(...)
        ceil(x)
        
        Return the ceiling of x as a float.
        This is the smallest integral value >= x.
    
    copysign(...)
        copysign(x, y)
        
        Return x with the sign of y.
    
    cos(...)
        cos(x)
        
        Return the cosine of x (measured in radians).
    
    cosh(...)
        cosh(x)
        
        Return the hyperbolic cosine of x.
    
    degrees(...)
        degrees(x)
        
        Convert angle x from radians to degrees.
    
    erf(...)
        erf(x)
        
        Error function at x.
    
    erfc(...)
        erfc(x)
        
        Complementary error function at x.
    
    exp(...)
        exp(x)
        
        Return e raised to the power of x.
    
    expm1(...)
        expm1(x)
        
        Return exp(x)-1.
        This function avoids the loss of precision involved in the direct evaluation of exp(x)-1 for small x.
    
    fabs(...)
        fabs(x)
        
        Return the absolute value of the float x.
    
    factorial(...)
        factorial(x) -> Integral
        
        Find x!. Raise a ValueError if x is negative or non-integral.
    
    floor(...)
        floor(x)
        
        Return the floor of x as a float.
        This is the largest integral value <= x.
    
    fmod(...)
        fmod(x, y)
        
        Return fmod(x, y), according to platform C.  x % y may differ.
    
    frexp(...)
        frexp(x)
        
        Return the mantissa and exponent of x, as pair (m, e).
        m is a float and e is an int, such that x = m * 2.**e.
        If x is 0, m and e are both 0.  Else 0.5 <= abs(m) < 1.0.
    
    fsum(...)
        fsum(iterable)
        
        Return an accurate floating point sum of values in the iterable.
        Assumes IEEE-754 floating point arithmetic.
    
    gamma(...)
        gamma(x)
        
        Gamma function at x.
    
    hypot(...)
        hypot(x, y)
        
        Return the Euclidean distance, sqrt(x*x + y*y).
    
    isinf(...)
        isinf(x) -> bool
        
        Check if float x is infinite (positive or negative).
    
    isnan(...)
        isnan(x) -> bool
        
        Check if float x is not a number (NaN).
    
    ldexp(...)
        ldexp(x, i)
        
        Return x * (2**i).
    
    lgamma(...)
        lgamma(x)
        
        Natural logarithm of absolute value of Gamma function at x.
    
    log(...)
        log(x[, base])
        
        Return the logarithm of x to the given base.
        If the base not specified, returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.
    
    log10(...)
        log10(x)
        
        Return the base 10 logarithm of x.
    
    log1p(...)
        log1p(x)
        
        Return the natural logarithm of 1+x (base e).
        The result is computed in a way which is accurate for x near zero.
    
    modf(...)
        modf(x)
        
        Return the fractional and integer parts of x.  Both results carry the sign
        of x and are floats.
    
    pow(...)
        pow(x, y)
        
        Return x**y (x to the power of y).
