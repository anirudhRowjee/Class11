Please carefully review the files before making any changes. Unfriendly requests not welcome :P

Update 6/8/2018 ->
  most files have been updated. Would recommend you clone repository and check out the following programs - 
    1) matrix.py for NxN square matrix transpose and multiplication for any N
    2) tictactoe.py for a simple yet not-so-idiot-proof game of noughts and crosses. FIrst person to point out the error gets          brownie points!
